# C1 - Behavioral Security

## Overview

The underlying premise of behavioral security is that all operationally relevant threats and attacks can be discerned through visibility into network traffic behavior. Infiltrated networks exhibit host-connection patterns that deviate from historical, or normal, connection patterns. These deviations, or anomalies, support clear analysis of the new threat and help suggest the most effective mitigation response.
